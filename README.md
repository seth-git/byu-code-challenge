# BYU Code Challenge
### To run this node service, you must provide the api-key by placing it in an webservice/api-key.txt file.
### Start the node service as follows:
 * `cd webservice`
 * `npm run start`
### An example call to the service is: http://localhost:3000/movies?search=the+international

### Normally, I would add an .npmrc file with engine-strict=true to constrain the node version, but didn't for the sake of not making you re-install node.
